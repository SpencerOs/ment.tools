    ment is built entirely using Swift, leveraging mlx-swift for efficient and rapid generation of responses. This approach allows us to deliver a high-performance application without relying on Python, ensuring a more streamlined and optimized experience for our users.

  <p>
    Our team is small but dedicated, and we are led by Spencer Oswald, who serves as the CEO, hat-wearer, and taste-maker. We believe in transparency and professionalism, and you can learn more about our leadership by connecting with Spencer on LinkedIn.

    Users of ment benefit from a fully on-device experience, ensuring privacy and the ability to use the app without a network connection once models are downloaded. We have taken measures to encrypt conversations on disk, and there are no rate limits or recurring charges. The base app launches for free, making it accessible to everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    we believe in giving you, the user, complete control over how your ai operatesâ€”from 
    customizing system prompts to referencing your own documents locally
