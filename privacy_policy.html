    </p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      ment is designed to be fully functional offline. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information from your device. After you download the app and the necessary model weights, all processing occurs locally on your device.

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All information, including messages and conversation details, is encrypted on your device using Appleâ€™s CryptoKit. This ensures that your data remains secure and private at all times.

    <h2>Offline Operation</h2>

      ment operates entirely offline once installed. This means that no data is sent to external servers or shared with third parties. Your interactions remain solely on your machine.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or regulatory requirements. When changes are made, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.
