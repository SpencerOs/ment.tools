  <h1>Ment Features</h1>
  <p>Ment is built to give you maximum control and privacy when it comes to AI chat. Below are some highlights:</p>

  <h2>Local Large Language Model</h2>
  <p>No external servers. No data leaks. Everything runs directly on your Apple device, giving you complete privacy and autonomy.</p>

  <h2>Customization &amp; Tweakability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>System Prompts:</strong> Define your AI’s role, style, and constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Branching Conversations:</strong> Keep multiple threads of discussion open with different contexts.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistant Profiles:</strong> Swap personalities or knowledge sets easily.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Offline Usage</h2>
  <p>Never worry about a lost internet connection. Ment doesn’t need the cloud to function—perfect for travel, remote areas, or simply preserving bandwidth.</p>

  <h2>PDF Integration (In Development)</h2>
  <p>Soon, you’ll be able to feed PDF documents directly into Ment to reference during your chats, unlocking a new level of contextual conversation.</p>
