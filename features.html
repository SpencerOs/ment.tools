  <h2>customization &amp; tweakability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>system prompts:</strong> define your ai’s role, style, and constraints</li>
    <li><strong>branching conversations:</strong> follow different paths of a converation by branching responses with different topics you'd love to <i>delve</i> in to</li>
    <li><strong>assistant profiles:</strong> swap personalities or knowledge sets easily</li>
  </ul>

  <p>never worry about a lost internet connection. <br />ment doesn’t need the cloud to function--perfect for travel, remote areas, or simply preserving bandwidth</p>
